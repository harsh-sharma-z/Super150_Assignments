// Given K painters to paint N boards where each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit of boards i.e. if the length of a particular board is 5, it will take 5 units of time to paint the board. Compute the minimum amount of time to paint all the boards.

// Note that:

// Every painter can paint only contiguous segments of boards.
// A board can only be painted by 1 painter at maximum.
// Input Format
// First line contains K which is the number of painters. Second line contains N which indicates the number of boards. Third line contains N space separated integers representing the length of each board.

// Constraints
// 1 <= K <= 10
// 1 <= N <= 10
// 1<= Length of each Board <= 10^8

// Output Format
// Output the minimum time required to paint the board.

// Sample Input
// 2
// 2
// 1 10
// Sample Output
// 10
